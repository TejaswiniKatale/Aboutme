Hi, Iâ€™m Tejaswini Katale. I am interested in research in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning. During my undergraduate studies, I completed research internships where I worked on algorithms for clustering, outlier elimination, domain-specific feature selection, and upsampling.
I have a good understanding of Python libraries, statistics, and algorithms. I am also skilled in SQL, Python, and AWS.
